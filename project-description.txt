Project Description: A random 2000s website

Ideas:
- I want to create a website that looks like it could have come out of the 2000s
- the early 2000s had a lot of wacky looking websites and I want to satirize it or something like that
- just feel like that could be funny, but who knows

Features:
- i think the most important feature are the odd striking color choices
- i don't know if it's because there were limited colors or not, but a lot of early 2000s websites had striking colors
- they were not always pretty, but they were memorable with strong blues and whites
